            It is a Carpooling (also car-sharing) app for 
              sharing of car journeys so that more than 
             person travels in a car, and prevents the need for others to
              have to drive to a location themselves.

            By having more people using one vehicle, 
            carpooling reduces each person's travel costs 
            such as: fuel costs, tolls, and the stress of driving.
                Carpooling is also a more environmentally friendly and 
                sustainable way to travel as sharing journeys reduces air
                pollution, carbon emissions, traffic congestion on the roads, and the need for 
                parking spaces. Authorities often encourage carpooling, especially during periods 
                of high pollution or high fuel prices. Car sharing is a good way to use up the full 
            seating capacity of a car, which would otherwise remain unused if it were just 
            the driver using the car
